      <description>About Untangled is a week of experimenting, designing and making using code. This will be a mix of web technology, games, interactive art and using data gathered from the world around us.

      <description>Creative Coding We will be using a javascript framework called P5.js which you can use to make games, interactive art, animations, musical instruments, physical models, geolocation tools, maps, generative speech and text, the list goes on and on.
p5.js You can read more about p5.js here and have a play around with some of the examples
If you like watching video tutorials there are loads on YouTube. Daniel Schiffman&amp;rsquo;s The Coding Train series is our favourite and a good place to start learning about p5.</description>
