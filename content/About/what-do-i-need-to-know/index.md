### What do I need to know?
<br>
#### How will I know if I have got a place on the course?

After you fill in our application form, you'll hear from us around the end of June to let you know if you have a place on the course.
Please don't be offended if you don't get on the course this time - we select the group to get a good range of skills and diversity so that everyone feels valued for who they are and what they can do, and most importantly has the best time that they can.
<br>
<br>

#### If I get a place, what will I be doing?
You will be making fun things using computers. Some of this will be writing code, some of it will be talking, designing, planning, breaking stuff, failing, succeeding and hopefully lots of learning. See [some of the examples on the p5.js website](https://p5js.org/examples/) to see the type of things you can do.
<br>
<br>
#### What do I need to bring?

You can bring your own laptop if you want to, but we have computers you can work on if you don’t.
<br>
<br>
#### How do I get to Untangled?
Untangled will take place at [Access Creative College](https://www.accesscreative.ac.uk/locations/norwich-college/) who have kindly let us use their building on Magdalen Street.
<br>
<br>
The address is:
<br>
<br>
Access Creative <br>
114 Magdalen Street <br>
Norwich <br>
NR3 1JD <br>
<br>
Please go to reception at 9am on the 5th August and say you are there for Untangled
<br>
<br>
#### What do I do about food?
Please bring a packed lunch with you. There's a nice big common room for you to eat in, but everyone has to stay in the building for the day.
<br>
<br>
#### How many other people will be there?
There will be 12 participants altogether, plus a load of coaches from various arts and tech backgrounds.
<br>
<br>
#### Is there anything I can do to get ready for Untangled?
We’re going to be using a javascript framework called p5.js, if you want to read about it/see some examples/try it out please have a read of the Creative Coding section.
