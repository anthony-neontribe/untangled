### Are you into tech, coding, designing or making things?

Maybe you've had a go at coding, made a simple website or even made your own game? Maybe you've hacked someone else's website or game apart to make your own?

Perhaps you've always wondered how those apps on your phone work that use your camera or microphone to make you look funny or your voice sound weird. Maybe you're interested in learning how to do that yoursef?

Maybe you've made music with computers, or done some animation,

Or maybe you've sat in an ICT lesson, knowing that you like the subject but wishing you could do something more fun or creative . . .

### What is Untangled?

Untangled is a week of experimenting, designing and making using code. This will be a mix of web technology, games, interactive art and using data gathered from the world around us. If you have a mobile phone, this is the one class where you're definitely encouraged to use it.

The course is run by [Neontribe](https://www.neontribe.co.uk/) and there will be lots of skilled people who work with art and technology to help you learn and to hopefully to make something that you can show off to your friends and family.

### Who can come?

Untangled is for 13 - 18 year olds who enjoy working with technology, and might have thought about working with technology in the future.

The best thing about it is that it's totally free! At Neontribe, we want to help the next generation of programmers to develop and learn and giving back is part of our culture.
